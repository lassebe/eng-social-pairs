A very silly app made for fun.

You'll need to edit `server/src/people.js` to include the people you want. It's not tracked by git.

Similarly, it expects to find images in `ui/src/images/` with filenames matching the names of the `people` array you've defined,
as well as importing those in `ui/src/images.js` and adding them to the exported object.
